Cucumbers contain Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5 and B6, folic acid, Vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Who needs a multivitamin?

The term “cool as a cucumber” is actually derived from the cucumber’s ability to cool the temperature of the blood. Also, when applied topically, cucumber really does cool the blood and ease facial swelling, which is why cucumbers are so popular in facial regimens.
